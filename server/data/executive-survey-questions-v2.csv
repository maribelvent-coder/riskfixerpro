1.1.1,"PII Exposure Scan: What Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the executive and family (home addresses, phone numbers, email, DOBs, vehicle details) is available on the open/deep/dark web?","Conduct a systematic OSINT investigation using professional tools and techniques to scan public records, data broker sites, social media, and dark web data breach repositories.","PII is the ""currency"" for attackers. It enables doxxing, social engineering, impersonation, and the planning of physical attacks. Identifying exposure is the first step to mitigating it.",Critical
1.1.2,"Residential Imagery Analysis: Is the executive's residence (and its vulnerabilities) clearly visible via online maps (e.g., Google Street View, satellite) or in public-facing media/social posts?","Use OSINT to search for the address and cross-reference with public-facing photos. Assess if satellite/street views reveal security features (or lack thereof), ""pattern of life"", or home floor plans.","Public imagery provides attackers with invaluable pre-attack surveillance data, allowing them to plan entry/exit routes and identify weaknesses without ever visiting the site.",High
1.1.3,"Dark Web Credential Check: Are the executive's corporate or personal email credentials (and those of their family/staff) present in known data breaches?","Utilize dark web monitoring services to check executive, family, and executive assistant email addresses against compiled breach databases.","Exposed credentials are the primary vector for Business Email Compromise (BEC), account takeover, and network intrusion. This is a direct, high-impact threat.",Critical
1.2.1,"Executive Social Media Policy & Practice Review: Does the executive actively use social media? If so, are privacy settings maximized? Does their content reveal sensitive information (e.g., real-time location, travel plans, opinions on controversial topics)?","Manually review all executive profiles and assess against a ""social media risk matrix"". Identify posts that reveal ""pattern of life"", future travel, or strong opinions that could attract ""opinion outrage"".","Executives are expected to be public-facing, but this creates a paradox. This review mitigates the risk of inadvertent information leakage that can be used for stalking, harassment, or attack planning.",Critical
1.2.2,"Family & Close Associate Social Media Review: Are the executive's family members (especially children) and close associates active on social media? Are their accounts private? Do they post sensitive information about the executive?","This is a crucial, often-missed step. Identify family/associate accounts and review them for ""secondary"" or ""third-party"" information leakage.","This is the ""extended attack surface"". Attackers target family accounts because they are typically less secure. A child's post or a spouse's post can leak data used for high-value fraud or physical threats.",Critical
1.3.1,"Routine & Predictability Analysis: Does the executive follow a highly predictable daily, weekly, or monthly schedule (e.g., same route to work, same restaurant on Tuesdays)?","Conduct a ""Pattern of Life"" (POL) analysis by mapping known activities. This is often done via discreet observation, interviews, and analysis of OSINT data.","Predictability is an attacker's single greatest asset. A predictable ""pattern of life"" makes planning an ambush, kidnapping, or other attack simple. The goal is to identify these patterns so they can be consciously varied.",Critical
1.3.2,"Review of Public-Facing Engagements: How are public engagements (speeches, board meetings, charity events) planned and assessed for risk?","Review the process for ""advance work"" for all public-facing events. This includes threat monitoring for the event, secure transport, and on-site protection.","Public engagements are points of high vulnerability, as time and place are predictable. A formal review process ensures risks are identified and mitigated for each event.",High
1.4.1,"Pre-Travel Risk Assessment Process: Is a formal, documented travel risk assessment (TRA) conducted for all executive travel (domestic and international)?","The TRA process should be standardized. It must analyze destination-specific threats (crime, civil unrest, political instability), leverage intelligence, and be tailored to the executive's profile.","This is the single most critical step in travel security. It forms the foundation of the entire travel plan and ensures that risks are proactively identified and mitigated, not discovered upon arrival.",Critical
1.4.2,"Security ""Advance"" Procedures: Are security ""advances"" (physical reconnaissance of all venues, routes, hotels, and hospitals) conducted by trained personnel prior to the principal's arrival?","An ""advance"" is the non-negotiable, most important part of a protection mission. It involves on-the-ground site surveys, route/alternate route mapping, liaison with local law enforcement, and emergency planning.","The advance ""eliminates surprises"". It identifies vulnerabilities (blind corners, unvetted staff) before the executive is exposed to them. It also reduces legal and financial liability by ensuring a documented, standards-based process was followed.",Critical
1.4.3,"Hotel Security Assessment: How are hotels selected? Are they assessed for security (e.g., access control, CCTV, fire safety, staff training)?","Use a standardized checklist (like the OSAC hotel assessment). The advance team should inspect physical security, CCTV/alarms, access control, and emergency exits. Requesting rooms on private/secure floors is also a best practice.","Hotels are high-risk ""soft targets"" with numerous vulnerabilities (theft, unauthorized access, cyber threats). A formal assessment ensures a ""defensible"" choice and mitigates risks.",High
