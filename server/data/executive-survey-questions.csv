Checklist Item,Best Practice for Conducting the Review,Rationale (Risk Mitigated),Importance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.1: Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) & Digital Footprint Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.1.1: PII Exposure Scan: What Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of the executive and family (home addresses, phone numbers, email, DOBs, vehicle details) is available on the open/deep/dark web?","Conduct a systematic OSINT investigation using professional tools and techniques to scan public records, data broker sites [33, 50], social media, and dark web data breach repositories.[30, 32]","PII is the ""currency"" for attackers. It enables doxxing 1, social engineering, impersonation [31], and the planning of physical attacks.2 Identifying exposure is the first step to mitigating it.[50]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.1.2: Residential Imagery Analysis: Is the executive's residence (and its vulnerabilities) clearly visible via online maps (e.g., Google Street View, satellite) or in public-facing media/social posts?","Use OSINT to search for the address and cross-reference with public-facing photos. Assess if satellite/street views reveal security features (or lack thereof), ""pattern of life"" [33], or home floor plans.2","Public imagery provides attackers with invaluable pre-attack surveillance data, allowing them to plan entry/exit routes and identify weaknesses without ever visiting the site.[33, 37]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.1.3: Dark Web Credential Check: Are the executive's corporate or personal email credentials (and those of their family/staff) present in known data breaches?,"Utilize dark web monitoring services to check executive, family, and executive assistant email addresses against compiled breach databases.[38, 50]","Exposed credentials are the primary vector for Business Email Compromise (BEC), account takeover 3, and network intrusion.[31, 51] This is a direct, high-impact threat.",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.2: Social Media Review (Executive & Family),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.2.1: Executive Social Media Policy & Practice Review: Does the executive actively use social media? If so, are privacy settings maximized? Does their content reveal sensitive information (e.g., real-time location, travel plans, opinions on controversial topics)?","Manually review all executive profiles and assess against a ""social media risk matrix"".[52, 53] Identify posts that reveal ""pattern of life"" [31, 39], future travel, or strong opinions that could attract ""opinion outrage"".[31]","Executives are expected to be public-facing [54, 55], but this creates a paradox.3 This review mitigates the risk of inadvertent information leakage that can be used for stalking, harassment, or attack planning.[39, 41]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.2.2: Family & Close Associate Social Media Review: Are the executive's family members (especially children) and close associates active on social media? Are their accounts private? Do they post sensitive information about the executive?,"This is a crucial, often-missed step. Identify family/associate accounts and review them for ""secondary"" or ""third-party"" information leakage.[38, 40]","This is the ""extended attack surface"".3 Attackers target family accounts [56, 57] because they are typically less secure. A child's post [38, 41] or a spouse's post 3 can leak data used for high-value fraud 4 or physical threats.3",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.3: Personal Practices & ""Pattern of Life"" Analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.3.1: Routine & Predictability Analysis: Does the executive follow a highly predictable daily, weekly, or monthly schedule (e.g., same route to work, same restaurant on Tuesdays)?","Conduct a ""Pattern of Life"" (POL) analysis [34, 35] by mapping known activities. This is often done via discreet observation, interviews, and analysis of OSINT data.[58]","Predictability is an attacker's single greatest asset.[58] A predictable ""pattern of life"" [59] makes planning an ambush, kidnapping, or other attack simple. The goal is to identify these patterns so they can be consciously varied.[60]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.3.2: Review of Public-Facing Engagements: How are public engagements (speeches, board meetings, charity events) planned and assessed for risk?","Review the process for ""advance work"" (see 1.4) for all public-facing events. This includes threat monitoring for the event, secure transport, and on-site protection.[61, 62]","Public engagements are points of high vulnerability, as time and place are predictable.[33] A formal review process ensures risks are identified and mitigated for each event.[61]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.4: Travel Security Program & ""Advance Work"" Review",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.4.1: Pre-Travel Risk Assessment Process: Is a formal, documented travel risk assessment (TRA) conducted for all executive travel (domestic and international)?","The TRA process should be standardized. It must analyze destination-specific threats (crime, civil unrest, political instability [63, 64]), leverage intelligence [42, 64], and be tailored to the executive's profile.[65, 66]","This is the single most critical step in travel security.[63, 67] It forms the foundation of the entire travel plan and ensures that risks are proactively identified and mitigated, not discovered upon arrival.[42, 68]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.4.2: Security ""Advance"" Procedures: Are security ""advances"" (physical reconnaissance of all venues, routes, hotels, and hospitals) conducted by trained personnel prior to the principal's arrival?","An ""advance"" is the non-negotiable, most important part of a protection mission.[69] It involves on-the-ground site surveys, route/alternate route mapping [68], liaison with local law enforcement [60, 70], and emergency planning.[71, 72, 73]","The advance ""eliminates surprises"".[72] It identifies vulnerabilities (blind corners, unvetted staff) before the executive is exposed to them.[42, 74] It also reduces legal and financial liability by ensuring a documented, standards-based process was followed.[75]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.4.3: Hotel Security Assessment: How are hotels selected? Are they assessed for security (e.g., access control, CCTV, fire safety, staff training)?","Use a standardized checklist (like the OSAC hotel assessment 5). The advance team should inspect physical security [76, 77, 78], CCTV/alarms [79], access control [78], and emergency exits.[80] Requesting rooms on private/secure floors is also a best practice.6","Hotels are high-risk ""soft targets"" with numerous vulnerabilities (theft, unauthorized access, cyber threats [76, 79]). A formal assessment ensures a ""defensible"" choice and mitigates risks.5",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.5: Secure Transportation Protocols,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.5.1: Vehicle & Driver Vetting: Are transportation providers (drivers and vehicles) thoroughly vetted? Are drivers trained in defensive/evasive driving?,"Use vetted, professional drivers, not rideshares.[39, 81] Drivers should be background-checked and trained.[82] Vehicles should be appropriate for the risk (low-profile [66] or armored [64]) and equipped with medical/comms gear.[83]","Mitigates the risk of accidents [82], ambushes [60], and surveillance.[81] The in-transit phase is one of the most vulnerable periods for an executive.[42]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.5.2: Route & Contingency Planning: Are primary and alternate routes planned for all movements? Are ""safe havens"" (e.g., police, hospitals, friendly offices) identified along the routes?","The advance team must plan, drive, and time all primary and alternate routes.[68] Routes should be varied to avoid predictability.[60]","This planning is essential to evade unexpected disruptions (protests, traffic [60, 84]) or deliberate attacks (ambushes [42]). It allows the team to be proactive, not reactive.",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.6: Travel Digital Security Hygiene,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.6.1: Use of VPN: Does the executive (and staff) consistently use a trusted Virtual Private Network (VPN) when on public Wi-Fi (hotels, airports)?","All connections to public or untrusted Wi-Fi must be routed through a corporate, ""always-on"" VPN.[39, 70]","Protects against credential theft, man-in-the-middle attacks, and eavesdropping, which are common on public networks.[85, 86]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.6.2: Use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Is MFA (preferably app-based, not SMS) enabled on all critical accounts (email, financial, VPN, social media)?","MFA should be mandated on all accounts.[39, 70]","This is the single most effective defense against credential theft.[86] Even if an attacker steals a password (via phishing or a breach [85]), MFA prevents them from gaining access.[87]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.1: Perimeter Security (CPTED & Landscaping),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.1.1: Natural Surveillance: Do landscaping and lighting promote ""natural surveillance""? Are entry points (front door, driveway) clearly visible from the street and from windows inside the home?","Landscaping should be trimmed to eliminate hiding spots.[46, 88] Trees should be ""limbed up,"" and shrubs ""hedged down."" The front door should be visible.[46]","CPTED aims to deter crime before it happens.[28, 48] Natural surveillance increases the perception of risk for an intruder, making them feel ""watched"".[47, 89, 90]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.1.2: Natural Access Control & Territoriality: Is the property line clearly defined? Are public paths (sidewalk) clearly separated from private property? Is the property well-maintained?,"Use fencing [91], low hedges, and clear pathways to guide visitors and define property lines.[28, 46] The property should be well-maintained to show a high degree of ""ownership"".[89, 92]","""Territoriality"" [28] signals that the space is cared for and actively monitored, which acts as a psychological deterrent to intruders.[47]",Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.2: Perimeter Security (Physical Barriers & Lighting),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.2.1: Fencing & Gates: Is the perimeter fence/wall of sufficient height and construction to delay entry? Are gates robust and equipped with secure, reliable locks?","Fences should be designed for security, not just aesthetics.[91] Gates should have high-quality locking mechanisms [93] and, if automated, be protected from being forced open. For high-risk, K-rated anti-ram barriers may be considered.[94]","This aligns with the ""Deter, Detect, Delay"" principle.[95] A strong fence/gate delays an intruder, ""buying time"" for the alarm system and response forces to work.",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.2.2: Security Lighting: Is the perimeter (especially entry points and ""dead zones"") adequately and uniformly illuminated?","Lighting should be uniform to avoid ""spotty lighting"" and deep shadows.[96, 97] Motion-activated lights can be effective deterrents [98], but ""always-on"" lighting in critical areas is also needed.[99]","Eliminates shadows that provide concealment for an intruder.[97] Aids natural and technical (CCTV) surveillance.[88, 99]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.2.3: Perimeter Clear Zones: Is a ""clear zone"" maintained on both sides of the perimeter fence?","Maintain a clear, unobstructed zone free of vegetation, debris, or storage.[100, 101, 102]","This is critical. A clear zone removes all potential hiding places for an intruder [102], allows for a clear line of sight for patrols and cameras, and prevents the fence from being easily climbed or bypassed.[101] It also serves as a firebreak.[103]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.3: Access Control & Physical Hardening (Doors, Windows, Locks)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.3.1: Door & Lock Security: Are all exterior doors (including from the garage) solid-core or steel? Are they equipped with high-quality (Grade 1) deadbolt locks [104] with a minimum 1-inch throw?,"Assess all doors against security standards (e.g., PAS24, LPS1175 [29]). Locks should be professionally installed [105] and include heavy-duty strike plates. Double-cylinder deadbolts may be used on doors with glass panels.[104]",Doors and windows are the most common and easiest breach points.[106] High-quality locks and solid doors are the most important factor in residential security [107] for delaying forced entry.,Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.3.2: Window Security: Are ground-floor and accessible windows secured with effective locks? Has reinforced/security glazing been considered?,"Assess all window lock types.[106] For high-risk, consider security films or laminated/ballistic glazing to resist forced entry or projectiles.[105, 108]","Unsecured or easily broken windows are a primary vulnerability. Enhanced glazing is a key ""hardening"" measure.[108]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.4: Interior Security Systems (Alarm, CCTV, PIDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.4.1: Intrusion Detection System (Alarm): Is a professionally installed and monitored alarm system in place? Does it have adequate sensor coverage (doors, windows, motion, glass break)?","The system must be professionally monitored.[109] Conduct a sensor-by-sensor ""walk-test"" to ensure all zones are covered and functional.","The alarm system is the primary ""Detect"" and ""Respond"" function. A comprehensive assessment identifies vulnerabilities [110, 111] and ensures the system is reliable.[112]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.4.2: Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV): Does the CCTV system provide full coverage of the perimeter, entry points, and ""dead zones""? Is footage of sufficient quality and recorded for an adequate duration?",Assess camera placement for coverage.[108] Ensure smart analytics are used [108] and that the system is integrated with other security layers.,"CCTV provides real-time assessment of alarms (deterring false alarms [95]), records evidence, and acts as a psychological deterrent.",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.4.3: Duress / Panic Alarms: Are fixed and/or wireless panic alarms available in key areas (master bedroom, home office, safe room)?",Panic alarms should be tested regularly and be linked to the monitored alarm system.[113],"Provides a direct, immediate summons for help in an active threat scenario (e.g., home invasion, medical emergency).",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.5: Specialized Residential Protections,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.5.1: Household Staff Vetting: Is there a formal, documented process for vetting all household staff (nannies, chefs, gardeners, contractors)?","The process must go beyond basic checks. It should include in-depth, professional background investigations [114, 115], thorough reference verification [116, 117], and signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).[116]","This mitigates the insider threat.[115, 118, 119] Staff have unparalleled access to the executive's family, property, and sensitive information. A failure in vetting is a critical vulnerability.[114]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.5.2: Safe Room / Panic Room: Does the residence have a designated ""safe room""? If so, does it meet FEMA P-361 / ICC 500 standards?","Inspect the ""safe room."" A true safe room is not just a closet.[24] It must be structurally reinforced, have a hardened door, and contain independent communications. It must be easily accessible [24] and stocked with emergency supplies.[25, 120]","Provides ""near-absolute protection"" [26] in a worst-case scenario (home invasion, tornado [24, 25, 27]). This is a life-safety ""last-resort"" control.",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.5.3: Technical Surveillance Countermeasures (TSCM): Are regular, professional TSCM (""bug"") sweeps conducted of the residence, especially the home office?","Engage a professional TSCM team [121, 122] to conduct a full physical and electronic sweep (RF analysis, thermal imaging [123, 124]) of sensitive areas.[125, 126]","Protects against corporate and personal espionage.[123] Sensitive business discussions and private family matters are vulnerable to eavesdropping.[127, 128]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.6: Residential Emergency & Response Planning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.6.1: Family Emergency Plan: Does the family have a simple, rehearsed plan for key emergencies (fire, medical, home invasion)?","The plan should include evacuation routes, rally points, and procedures for contacting emergency services and the protection detail.[129]","In an emergency, confusion leads to injury.[130] A simple, rehearsed plan ensures family members know how to react, account for each other, and get to safety.[129, 131]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.1: Executive Floor Physical Security & CPTED,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.1.1: CPTED of Executive Suite: Does the layout of the executive floor apply CPTED principles? Is the reception/E.A. station positioned to control access and observe the ""public"" areas (e.g., elevator lobby)?","The reception desk should have natural surveillance over all entry points.[46, 132] Use ""natural access control"" (furniture, pathways) to guide visitors.[28]","CPTED principles create an environment that is more difficult for an unauthorized person to exploit, acting as a deterrent.[88]",Medium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.1.2: Physical Hardening of Executive Office: Are the walls of the executive office ""slab-to-slab"" (or otherwise secured above the drop ceiling)? Is the door solid-core with a high-quality lock?",Review construction documents [133] or conduct a physical inspection to verify that walls are full-height. Assess door/lock hardware.[134],Mitigates covert entry (by climbing over a non-slab-to-slab wall) and forced entry. This is a common vulnerability in standard office construction.,High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.2: Executive Access Control (RBAC),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.2.1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policy: Is access to the executive floor and suite based on a documented ""Role-Based Access Control"" (RBAC) policy, or is it managed ad-hoc?","Implement a formal RBAC system.[135, 136] Access permissions should be tied to a job function (e.g., ""Executive Staff,"" ""C-Suite"") not to an individual.[137, 138, 139]","RBAC enforces the ""Principle of Least Privilege"".[140] It is far more secure, scalable, and auditable [136, 141] than managing hundreds of individual permissions, which leads to ""privilege creep"" and human error.[136]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.2.2: Access Control Audit: Is the access list for the executive floor audited on a regular (e.g., quarterly) basis to remove former employees or those whose roles have changed?","Conduct regular, documented audits of the access control logs and permission lists.[142, 143]","Prevents ""privilege creep"" and ensures that unauthorized individuals (like ex-employees) cannot retain access.[142, 143]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.3: Visitor Management & Control Protocols,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.3.1: Visitor Management System: Is a formal visitor management system (VMS) used? Does it replace insecure paper logs? Does it require host notification and ID verification?,"Implement a digital VMS.[144, 145] Visitors should be pre-registered, have their ID verified, and be logged in the system.[144] Paper logs are illegible and a privacy risk.[145]","Enhances security by preventing unauthorized access and ""piggybacking"".[146, 147] It creates an auditable, real-time record of who is in the space, which is critical for emergency accountability.[147, 148, 149]",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.3.2: Visitor Escort Policy: Is there a strictly enforced policy requiring all visitors to be personally escorted at all times while on the executive floor?,"Mandate a ""host-escort"" policy.[134] No visitor should be unaccompanied in the executive area.","This is a simple, critical control that prevents visitors from wandering into sensitive areas, accessing information, or planting devices.",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.4: Secure Communications & Information Handling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.4.1: Secure Mail Screening Procedures: Is all mail and all packages for the executive (and office) screened for threats (CBRNE) at a secure location?,"Mail should ideally be screened at an off-site or isolated facility [150, 151] by trained personnel using specialized equipment (e.g., X-ray [152]). Assess handling procedures for suspicious items.[153, 154, 155]","Mitigates the high-impact risk of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or explosive (CBRNE) threat [151] delivered via mail.[156] It also prevents business disruption, reputational damage, and psychological harm.[150, 157, 158]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.4.2: Office TSCM (""Bug Sweep""): Are regular, professional TSCM sweeps conducted of the executive office(s), boardroom, and sensitive meeting areas?","Engage a professional TSCM team to sweep all sensitive areas, especially before high-stakes meetings (e.g., M&A, legal).[126, 159, 160]","This is a primary defense against corporate espionage, insider threats, and the theft of intellectual property or strategic plans.[128, 159, 160]",Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.5: Executive Emergency Evacuation & Shelter-in-Place,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.5.1: Executive-Specific Evacuation Plan: Is there a specific, documented, and rehearsed emergency evacuation plan for the executive that is separate from the general employee plan?","The plan must be tailored to the executive.[161] It must define evacuation procedures, routes, and actions for the executive and their immediate staff.[129] It must be practiced.[130, 131]",The executive is a target and may be the reason for the evacuation.[161] A general-population plan is insufficient as it may lead the executive toward a threat. This plan ensures leadership continuity and safety.[162],Critical,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.5.2: Shelter-in-Place (SIP) Plan: Has a specific, secure SIP location been identified for the executive in the event of an external threat (e.g., active shooter, civil unrest)?","Identify an interior room (ideally with reinforced construction and a comms plan) as the designated SIP location, as distinct from a general evacuation.[129, 163]","Not all emergencies require evacuation.[129, 163] In an active shooter or external chemical release scenario, a ""shelter-in-place"" plan is the correct life-safety procedure.",High,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
