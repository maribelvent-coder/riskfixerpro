# RiskFixer AI Framework — Strategic To-Do List

**Last Updated:** December 6, 2025

---

## Phase 1: Data Foundation
*Convert existing framework docs to working code*

- [ ] **1.1** Interview questionnaires → TypeScript (5 templates)
- [ ] **1.2** Scoring rubrics with evidence criteria (5 templates)
- [ ] **1.3** Integrate threat library catalogs (5 templates) ← *created today*

---

## Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
*The sophisticated calculation engines — THIS IS THE CRITICAL GAP*

- [x] **2.1** Office interview→risk mapper ✅ *(900 lines, complete)*
- [ ] **2.2** Retail interview→risk mapper (300-500 lines)
- [ ] **2.3** Warehouse interview→risk mapper (300-500 lines)
- [ ] **2.4** Datacenter interview→risk mapper (300-500 lines)
- [ ] **2.5** Manufacturing interview→risk mapper (300-500 lines)

---

## Phase 3: AI Grounding
*What makes the AI "smart" instead of hallucinating*

- [ ] **3.1** Industry standards prompts (5 templates)
- [ ] **3.2** Control effectiveness data (5 templates)
- [ ] **3.3** Threat intelligence integration (CAP Index + industry data)

---

## Phase 4: AI Services
*Shared services that power AI-enhanced assessments*

- [ ] **4.1** AI risk assessment service (grounded prompts + validation)
- [ ] **4.2** Assessment context builder (interview → AI prompt)
- [ ] **4.3** AI narrative generation (exec summary, risk landscape)

---

## Phase 5: Presentation
*What the client sees*

- [ ] **5.1** Universal dispatcher (routes to correct template) ← *created today*
- [ ] **5.2** PDF report templates (4 remaining templates)
- [ ] **5.3** End-to-end integration testing

## Progress Summary

| Phase | Status | Blocking? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Phase 1: Data | 📋 Specs exist, needs code | No |
| Phase 2: Intelligence | 🔴 1 of 5 complete | **YES** |
| Phase 3: AI Grounding | ❌ Not started | No |
| Phase 4: AI Services | ❌ Not started | **YES** |
| Phase 5: Presentation | ⚠️ Partial | No |

---

## Quick Reference: What's Done vs. Not Done

| ✅ Done | ❌ Not Done |
|---------|-------------|
| All framework documentation | Interview→risk mappers (4 of 5) |
| All questions with polarity | AI services |
| Office mapper (900 lines) | Industry standards prompts |
| Threat catalogs (all 5) | Control effectiveness data |
| Master methodology | Report templates (4 of 5) |

---

## Recommended Next Action

**Build Retail interview→risk mapper** as reference implementation, then replicate pattern for remaining templates.
