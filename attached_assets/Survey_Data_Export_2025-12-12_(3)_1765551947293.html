Multiple death threats via email from a terminated CFO (Marcus Reynolds) who blamed me for his indictment. He has publicly vowed revenge and is active on dark web forums discussing me. Also received anonymous letters at home with disturbingly specific details about my family&#039;s daily schedule. Two instances of being followed by unknown vehicles (silver sedan, reported to police). Threatening voicemails on personal cell phone from blocked numbers. I screen calls through my EA but emails come directly to me.&quot;,

(3) Disgruntled investor group from failed acquisition - threatening class action and have made veiled threats. (4) Anonymous online persona tracking and posting my movements on social media. Internal: Several layoff-related complaints including one employee who stated I would \&quot;regret\&quot; the decision.&quot;,

      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;No formal training received. I have never been trained on threat response protocols or how to handle threatening communications. I typically try to de-escalate or end calls quickly, but I&#039;m not confident I&#039;m handling these correctly.&quot;,

      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;I usually try to remain calm and end the call as quickly as possible. Sometimes I engage trying to understand what the person wants. I don&#039;t have a protocol for documenting these incidents or reporting them consistently. My EA keeps some notes but there&#039;s no formal logging system. Some threatening emails have been deleted rather than preserved for evidence.&quot;,

      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;No close protection. I currently have no personal security detail, no executive protection services, and no security driver. I travel alone to all appointments, drive myself to and from work daily, and attend public events without security escort. My wife has expressed serious concerns about this given the threats we&#039;ve received.&quot;,

      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;Very concerned about the lack of protection. Given the active threats from the former CFO, the persistent stalker, and the online tracking, I am increasingly worried for both my safety and my family&#039;s safety. My wife has had panic attacks about security. I realize I need professional protection but haven&#039;t known where to start.&quot;,

      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;No, I don&#039;t notify anyone about public appearances. I regularly appear at industry conferences, shareholder meetings, media interviews, and charity events without informing any security personnel. My schedule for public events is often posted on the company website and shared on social media in advance.&quot;,

      &quot;yesNoResponse&quot;: true,
      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;Yes, absolutely. At 3 events in the past year, the obsessed individual \&quot;Jennifer\&quot; appeared and tried to approach me. At a charity gala, she got within arm&#039;s length before security intervened. At a recent shareholder meeting, there were protesters specifically targeting me with signs showing my home address. During a TV interview, someone called in a threat that required police response. I feel very exposed at all public events.&quot;,

      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;Highly predictable. Every weekday: Leave home 7:15am, same route to office, arrive 7:40am, same parking spot P1-Executive. Monday/Wednesday/Friday: 6am workout at Equinox on 63rd Street, same time, same locker. Every Saturday: 9am tennis at Greenwich Country Club. Every Sunday: 11am brunch at The Smith, same table.

Saturdays at Greenwich Country Club for golf/tennis. Sunday services at First Presbyterian, same pew. Monthly board dinners at The Yale Club, same private room.

      &quot;yesNoResponse&quot;: false,
      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;Minimal security. Primary residence: Basic ADT alarm system (door/window sensors only), Ring video doorbell, 2 outdoor cameras with poor coverage. No 24/7 monitoring, no panic buttons, no safe room. 4-foot decorative wrought iron fence that could be easily climbed. Gate code hasn&#039;t been changed in 2 years and was shared with contractors. No security personnel. Vacation home in Aspen: Even less security, just basic locks.&quot;,

      &quot;textResponse&quot;: &quot;No. I&#039;m not confident in our security setup. My wife doesn&#039;t know how to properly arm the system. Children (12 and 15) sometimes forget to set the alarm. We had a suspicious person photographed on our property line in February 2024 and a threatening package delivered in April. Ring camera captured a trespasser at 2am in June. We don&#039;t feel safe but don&#039;t know what to improve first.&quot;,
