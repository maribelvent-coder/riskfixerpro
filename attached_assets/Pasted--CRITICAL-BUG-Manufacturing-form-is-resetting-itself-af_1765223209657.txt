"CRITICAL BUG: Manufacturing form is resetting itself after autosave, creating a destructive loop.

Console shows:
1. User enters value → CHANGE detected
2. AUTOSAVE fires with correct value (45000)
3. AUTOSAVE SUCCESS
4. CHANGE detected again (not by user!)
5. AUTOSAVE fires with UNDEFINED value
6. Form clears itself

This is a RACE CONDITION between:
- Autosave completing
- React Query refetching/updating form state
- Form resetting to server data (which may not have the new value yet)

THE FIX:

1. DON'T RESET FORM FROM SERVER DATA WHILE USER IS EDITING:

   The useProfileAutosave hook or the form component is probably doing:
   
   useEffect(() => {
     if (serverData) {
       form.reset(serverData);  // THIS IS THE PROBLEM
     }
   }, [serverData]);
   
   This resets the form every time data refetches, overwriting user's input.

2. SOLUTION A - Only reset on initial load:

   const [initialized, setInitialized] = useState(false);
   
   useEffect(() => {
     if (serverData && !initialized) {
       form.reset(serverData);
       setInitialized(true);
     }
   }, [serverData, initialized]);

3. SOLUTION B - Track dirty state and don't overwrite:

   useEffect(() => {
     if (serverData && !form.formState.isDirty) {
       form.reset(serverData);
     }
   }, [serverData]);

4. SOLUTION C - Disable refetch while editing:

   const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
   
   useQuery({
     ...
     enabled: !isEditing,  // Don't refetch while user is editing
   });

5. CHECK the useProfileAutosave hook:
   
   grep -A 30 'useProfileAutosave\|useEffect.*reset\|form.reset' client/src/hooks/useProfileAutosave.ts
   
   Find where form.reset() is being called and add the guard.

6. ALSO CHECK ManufacturingDashboard.tsx:
   
   grep -n 'reset\|useEffect.*data' client/src/pages/assessments/ManufacturingDashboard.tsx
   
   Is there a useEffect that resets the form when data changes?

The same fix should be applied to ALL dashboard components to prevent this race condition.

This is why Office/Retail/Warehouse might work - they may not be refetching as aggressively, or their forms handle the reset differently."
