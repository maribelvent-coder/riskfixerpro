"CRITICAL BUG: Assessment answers are NOT being saved.

UX Test Results:
- User answered 5 questions in Office Building assessment
- Progress showed "5 of 102 completed"
- User navigated away then returned
- ALL ANSWERS LOST - Progress reset to "0 of 102 completed"

This is a production-blocking issue. Please investigate:

1. FIND THE SAVE MECHANISM:
   grep -rn 'save\|persist\|submit\|auto.*save' client/src/components/FacilitySurvey.tsx
   
   - Is there an auto-save function?
   - What triggers it? (onChange, onBlur, debounce timer?)
   - What API endpoint does it call?

2. CHECK THE SAVE API ENDPOINT:
   grep -rn 'facility.*survey\|survey.*save\|assessment.*save' server/routes.ts
   
   - Does POST/PATCH endpoint exist?
   - What table does it write to?

3. CHECK BROWSER NETWORK TAB:
   - When answering a question, is ANY API call being made?
   - If yes, what's the response? (200, 400, 500?)
   - If no, the frontend isn't calling the save function

4. CHECK THE DATABASE:
   - After answering questions, are they in facility_survey_questions?
   
   SELECT fsq.question_id, fsq.answer, fsq.updated_at
   FROM facility_survey_questions fsq
   JOIN assessments a ON fsq.assessment_id = a.id
   WHERE a.template_id LIKE '%office%'
   ORDER BY fsq.updated_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;

5. LIKELY CAUSES:

   A) Auto-save not triggering:
      - Missing onChange/onBlur handler
      - Debounce timer too long or never fires
      
   B) API call failing silently:
      - No error handling showing user
      - CORS or auth issue
      
   C) Wrong table/column being updated:
      - Writing to wrong place
      - Data not associated with correct assessment_id
      
   D) Read not matching write:
      - Saving to one place, loading from another

6. IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:
   - Add console.log to save function to confirm it's being called
   - Add console.log to API endpoint to confirm it's receiving data
   - Add error toast if save fails
   - Consider adding explicit "Save" button as backup

7. ALSO FIX (lower priority):

   A) Assessment creation should prompt for details:
      - When clicking "Use This Template", show a modal/form asking for:
        * Assessment Name
        * Location
        * Assessor Name
      - THEN create the assessment with that metadata
   
   B) Add explicit Save button:
      - Even if auto-save works, users need visual confirmation
      - Add "Save Progress" button that shows "Saved ✓" feedback
   
   C) Fix Yes/No labels for office-building:
      - Same fix we did for warehouse
      - Populate risk_direction column from polarity

Please prioritize finding and fixing the save bug - this blocks all assessment functionality."
